# Class Notes

# CSCI 360

##### PROGRAMS LOCATED IN GITS FOLDER

##use hexitor for hexidecimal editing

### DAY SPLIT 1
-------------------------
- filezilla to transfer files

### DAY SPLIT 2
-------------------------
- Editing in ISPF-- document available on blackboard --has shortcuts
- console size 93 x 46


### DAY SPLIT 3
-------------------------
- can purge anything but KC-myNumber
- Job control language (JCL) requires something on every line, so does assembler
- assembler separation uses the comment charater *
- =SD.ST from the command line goes to current jobs
-  put a S next to any job I want to view
- 8 bits to a byte

###  DAY SPLIT 4
-------------------------
- csci 465 necessary for a job in assembler

##### unnecessary information
-------------------------------------------
- mainframe does not use ascii, rather ebcdic
- ebcdic only has 256 possiblities
- ascii is a subset of unicode
-------------------------------------------

### DAY SPLIT 5
-------------------------
##### overflows produce abbends
- but so do exceptions and various other things


- D(b) --- register plus displacement
- GP regs -- 16 general purpose registers -- hex : 0-F -- Dec: 0 -15
- D(x,b) --- register plus displacement plus other registers
- {_xx} designates a subscript

##### resolving addresses
- R0 <- 00 0E FA FF
- R7 <- 00 00 00 32
- R3 <- 00 00 00 17

-----------------------------
- Displacement (base register)
>> eg -> 22{_10}(7) >>  16{_16}(7)
>> 16 + R7 -> 16 + 32 = 00 00 00 48{_16}
------------------------------

-------------------------------
- Displacement(index register, base register)

>> eg -> 22{_10}(7,3) >> 16{_16}(7,3)
>> 16 + R7 + R3 -> 16 + 32 + 17 = 00 00 00 5F{_16}
-------------------------------

- overflow in displacment creates abbend
- 4 signed bytes to each register in this case
- 32 bits per register

-----------------------
- Displacment(,base register) --------- **R0 is ignored**

>> eg-> 22{_10}(,3) >> 16{_16}(,3)
>> 16 + R3 -> 16 + 17 = 00 00 00 2D{_16}
-----------------------

- if D(b) and requires D(x,b) then will encode D(b) as D(3,0) which is an error
- **register 0, 1, 12, 13, 14, 15 are off limits?**

    LA 3,22,(7,2)
>>  load result of 22(7,2) into register 3

- register 15 points to the beginning of our programs
- everything here is 24-bit addressing


###Day Split 5
---------------------------
- MAIN is a label --- use ASSIGN3A for the label in assign3
- labels have a maximum size of 8 characters
- labels may not begin with a digit
- national characters( ie # are also allowed, but discouraged)

**An analysis of prog1 and some various other notes**

-----------------------------------------
- CSECT is the first instruction and END is the last


###important
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- all instructions must go in column 10 and all labels in column 1
- all operands and parameters go in column 16
----------------------------------------------------------------------
###END important

- XOR R_1, R_1 and SR R_1, R_1 both zero a register (USE SR)
- BR 14 means branch on register 14 (sends machine back to OS)
- END wraps up CSECT

-----------------------------------------

- Assist simulates 24 bit addressing
- this can be stored in the right most 3 bytes of a register
- the leftmost byte is always set to 0's 
- addresses are always stored in the rightmost bytes

- R 15 will always be 0's  this is unnatural as 0->some large number
- stores the operating system

>> in short, this is a simplification made by Assist

**various Assist notes that do with output **

- look for condition code and return code (RC)
- LOC --location counter
- OBJECT CODE - the actual instruction
- ADDR1- the displacement off of the first register
- ADDR2 displacement off of the base register for the second operand
- STMT - statement
- 1B is the operation code for subtraction
- 1B33 is subtract R_3 from R_3
- 1B34 is subtract R_4 from R_3(then store in R_3)
- LOC is affected by displacement(0 + address length)

--------------------------------------------

###Day Split 6
-------------------------------------------

- Using progName, 15 establishes the base register at 15
- all storage declarations go after the break statement
- LTORG --literals are organized after this statement
- a fullword is 4 bytes
- DS --define storage 
- DC --define constant
- XDUMP --likely a macro on assist
- ST  R,var/location
- assembler has two passes
>>first one resolves addresses,
>>the second converts instructions to executables

- XDUMP D(X,B),length --dumps from D(X,B) to D(X,B) + length
- L 3,=F'25'     Loads R_3 with 25


####important
--------------------------------------------------------
>> always use LTORG

---------------------------------------------------------
####end important

###Day Split 7
--------------------------------------------

- instructions (eg: XDUMP) start in column 10
- RR - register to register
- RX - register to location
- AR - add register RR
- SR - subtract register RR
- XDUMP - RX and BLANK dump memory in a specific location or dump registers(blank version)
- L load register RX loads register with value from memory
- abend - abnormal ending
- if an address % 4 = 0, then it is a fullword boundary
- each line begins on a 32 byte boundary	

###Day Split 8
----------------------------------------------

- did explicit addressing
- LA -- load address. makes a pointer out of the register

###Day Split 9
----------------------------------------------
- condition codes are located in yellow card
- XREAD -- read file goes in column 10 args  D(X,B),length 
- the dxb is an input buffer
- set aside a buffer with a name that has a reasonable size(80)
- length is almost always 80
- XREAD is an assist macro
- cond code 0 successful read, cond code 1 end of file reached
- buffer goes after ltorg, normally a DC
- ie
	BUFFER      DC     CL80
>> this reads define constant buffer with character length 80

- another way
	BUFFER     DC      80C'<your character here>'
>> this will fill buffer with 80 of <your character\> ie '%' would fill buffer with 80 %'s

- xdump buffer,80 will give 80 of <your character\> (ie %)
- now

	XREAD     BUFFER,80     READ THE FIRST RECORD
- now 


	LOOP1  BC      B'0100',ENDLOOP1

	
			*process record

		XREAD     BUFFER,80

      		  BC     B'1111',LOOP1    branch unconditionally to LOOP1

	ENDLOOP1 BR    14               branch to os

>> this is a top driven loop

- 1000  means branch on condition code 0, 0100 branch on condition code 1
- 0010 branch on condition code 2, 0001 branch on condition code 3
- 1111 branch no matter what and check conditions to leave loop
- so 0110 would be branch if condition code is 1 or 2


>> in hw 4 the numbers go after end main
>> .....
- there is also BCR which is branch on register condition

###Day Split 10
------------------------------------------------
- quiz on monday, study guide on blackboard
- 4 bytes to fullword
- registers that we can use 2-12

	XDECI     R,D(X,B)

- converts number at D(X,B) to binary and stores it in the register
- for first number

	XDECI   2,BUFFER    reads first file to binary into r2
	XDECI   3,0(0,1)    reads second file to binary into r3
	XDECI   4,0(0,1)       read  third  file to binary into r4
        SR      5,5
        AR      5,2
        AR      5,3
        AR      5,4          r5 now holds total of all three numbers
###Day Split 11
------------------------------------------------

- XDECO requires exactly 12 bytes of storage
- OUTREC  DC  ' '  is spacing
- OUTREC  DC  '-'  double spacing
- first byte is control

        LABEL0    DC    C'0'
                  DC     5C' '
	LABEL     DS    CL12
	          DC     5C' '
        LABEL2    DS    CL12
                  DC     5C' '
        LABEL3    DS    CL12
                  DC     5C' '
        SUM       DS    CL12
                  DC    64C' '

- this allows output to be on the same line with a space in between
- deco to each of these in order to put all of these on the same line
- when prnt use 133 bytes and label0  ie  xprnt    label0,133
 
# ask about formatting
# ask about why records are required to be in second column

- define storage in line =F'1'

	A      6,=F'1'     increment R6 by 1
	LA     6,1(,6)     also increment by 1



-  DC    C'0' double space

###Day Split 12
----------------------------------------------
- compare two values and branch if greater than

	LA    4, CALCIT
	C     3,VALUE
	BCR   B'0010', 4

- compare registers
	
	LA    4,CALCIT
	CR    3,5
	BCR   B'0010',4

- in yellow card, program-status word
- ILC -- two bits indicating the instruction length code
- CC -- condition code 34-35 
- interruption code
- instruction address -- next instruction 

###Day Split 13
------------------------------------------------

- Even-odd pair
- multiplication and division relevant
- M
- MR
- D
- DR

- even-odd pair has to have consecutive registers
- odd register contains the multiplicand
- odd gets the result
	L     3, =F'35'
	L     5, =F'2'
- or 
	LA    3,35
        LA    5,2
- now
	MR    2,5
>> output -> 70

- instructions start on pg 58
	X1    DC    F'2'

- now
	M     2,X1
- this is the D(x,b) version

- division
- uses even-odd pair
- odd holds dividen
- R5 <- 45
- R4 <-  
- sign bit for odd needs to go into the even register
- this is done as(for R4,R5 as the even-odd)
	SR    4,4          this sets all of the even bits to 0's
	L     9, =F'5'
	DR    4,9
>> divide 45 by 5
 
- if divisor is negative, then  L    4, = F'-1'
- ie load even register with all binary 1's
- LTR--load test register
- LTR     5,5 
- loads register into other, tests and sets condition code
- cc 0, result is zero;  1, first less than 0; 2, greater than zero
- normally look for cc = 1  because that means fill even part's bits with 1's
			LTR    5,5
			BC     B'1010'BRPAST1   branch if result is negative; cc = 0 or 2
			L      4, =F'-1'
			BC     B'1111',BRPAST2    branches if cc =1

	BRPAST1		SR     4,4
	BRPAST2	        *cmds here	
- divide by 0 creates abend  s0cb

###Day Split 14
--------------------------------------------

- division
- note, the even register of the pair must be zero
	DR    R2,R3     divide r3 by r2
	
- R3/R2
- the quotient will be stored in the odd register
- the remainder gets stored in the even register

	        SR        R2,R2
         	L         R3,=F'17'
         	L         R4,=F'3'
                DR        R2,R4       This does R3=Quotient of (R3/R4)    R2 = remainder of (R3/R4)
	* R2 = 5; R3 = 5; R4 = 3
         	DR 	  R2,Divisor  Where Divisor must be a F field
	* This is the alternative which uses a value from memory rather than a register

        	LTORG
DIVISOR         DC        F'3'
	
- SS (storage to storage (apparently not schutzestaffel)(the more you know))
- MVC - move character

		MVC   D(L,B), D(b)   where l is the length, b is the base register
		* moves from D(b) to D(x,b)

- ie
		MVC	 OUTNAME(40),CARD+24      Twenty four byte displacement from where CARD starts; move to OUTNAME
		*alternatively
		MVC	 OUTNAME(40),0(,1)        Works right after the xdeci statement
- records setup

	OUTREC		DC	 C' '         carriage control character (line format) carcon-> ' ' single space -> '0' double space -> '-' triple space -> '1' new page
	OUTFIRST	DS	 CL14
			DC       C' '
	OUTLAST		DS	 CL12
			DC	 CL105' '

- totals out to 133 bytes -- this is important
- to output all of this  XPRNT  OUTREC,133

- MVI     move immediate-- used to move a single byte of memory
- to change the carriage control

		MVI	 OUTREC,C'0'
- in order to clear output buffer
- link in bio in rogness's page	

faculty.cs.niu.edu/~rogness/mvc_instructions.jpg

-  use the last one to clear the buffer
- this is called a destructive overwrite
- BZ branch on condition code zero
TOP		BZ      4,ENDLOOP       branches on R4 condition code zero to endloop
		*do stuff
		BCTR	4,4		R4--; in c++
		LTR	4,4
		B	TOP

###Day Split 15
---------------------------------------------

- mvc
- can move a character string that has size between 2 and 256 bytes long
- mvi 
- move one character
- mvc is a six byte instruction

			MVC     ENTRY1(33),ENTRY0

			LTORG
	ENTRY0		DS	CL33
	ENTRY1		DS	CL40

- base and 3 hex digits encode displacement off of register
- length is encoded as the length - 1
- length 256 is 100 255 is FF
- max displacement is 4095-> FFF

- Carriage control
- if first byte has a dc of c'1' this stands for top of page
- if first byte has a dc of c' ' this stands for single space
- if first byte has a dc of c'0' this stands for double space
- if first byte has a dc of c'-' this stands for triple space
- if first byte has a dc of c'+' this stands for overwrite(bold)

- increment a register
	
		L	10,1(,10)

- signed mathematics
- if the digit caried in is the same as that carried out, then no overflow
- else, overflow

###Day Split 16
-------------------------------------------------

- psw (program status word)

{_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _}
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

- 24 bits represents next code address ( pointer) 6-8
- 16 bits for interuption code 3-4
- 4 bits for ILC(instruction length code) 5
- 2 bits of number 5 are used for ILC and 2 for carriage control
- interruption code - ie 0001 would be a s0c1 (op code invalid)

###Day Split 17
---------------------------------------------------

- psw continued

- S0C1   -operation exception -trying to execute a location in memory that does not hold a valid instruction
- S0C4   -protection exc -trying to access a valid address but not owned by me
- S0C5   -addressing exc -invalid address when trying to access a memory location outside of the limits
- S0C6   -specification exc -a catchall ie: unexpected value, boundary alignment
- S0C7   -data exc -caused by trying to manipulate a field that should have a  packed-decimal number but actually does not
- S0CB 	 -decimal divide exc- overflow from decimal arithmatic

- need to cause an abend?

	 DC	F'0'

- in the middle of the code


- appendix d has soc error list

###Day Split 18
---------------------------------------------------

- F5 is slackbyte
- the address of a fullword ends with 0,4,8,c
- in the dump, the two columns represent n and n+1
- ie
	000000                                 000010
        000020				       000030
	000040				       000050

- a halfword boundary is every two bytes	
- DSH, DCH  are for halfwords


###Day Split 19
-------------------------------------------------
####Homework examples and info
------------------------------
##############
- Slack bytes are extra bytes on an instruction that put the instruction on a boundary
>> they are normally the reason for an instruction that takes up 2 bytes
>> taking up more than 2 bytes

- 0, 4, 8, C, E  are all fullword byte desginations. All fullword boundaries end on a location that ends with one of these values

- NUMBER 13. CVB and CVD are the answers

- fullword is four byte

- for the question where you have to circle things, there is only one set of synonyms
#############

- ASSIST COMPLETION DUMP - lists interrupt code and various other info needed
-PSW	
	FFC500009 4000002C

- interruption code?
	00009

- address of the instruction that would be executed next if the ABEND had not occured?
	00002C                <- check yellow card for section that lists the different sections

- instruction length code, name?
	01, 1 in decimal     ILC

- condition code?
	00

- what is the address of the instruction that cause the ABEND?
	00002A

- what instruction set the value of the condition code (need the trace and the yellow card)?
	S	7,=F'3'               <- check yellow card to find which one sets the condition code

- what is the object code for the ABENDing instruction?
	1D87		<-found to the left of the instruction

- what do we find when we decode the objet code for the ABENDing instruction?
	1D is the operation code for divide register(DR) and the first operand is reg 8 and the second is reg 7 

- What actually caused the ABEND?(it is a S0C9)
	An attempt to divide by zero.

- this looks like
	R12	R13	R14	R15	R0	R1	R2	R3	R4	R5	R6	R7	R8	R9	R10

- structure
	MAIN CSECT
	.
	LTORG
	.
	SUBROUTINE
	.
	LTORG
	.
	END STATEMENT

- memorize
	BH	
	BNH
	BL	
	BNL	
	BZ
- et cetera
- decoding
		MVC	3(26,4),23(5)	TAKE 26 BYTES BEGINNING AT 3(5) AND MOVE TO 3(4)
			    B1	 B2

26 = X1A   =>  25 = X19

		D2	19	40	03	50	17
		MVC	LEN	B1	D	B2	D

- second byte always contains length

###Day Split 27
--------------------------------------------------
- can declare parmlist before or after storage
- can have as many parm list as I want in any particular subroutine
- BAL should use R11, takes rightmost 3 bytes of psw and puts them into R11 then branches 
- can either define storage 0 halfwords or put first instruction on subroutine label
- store only the registers we will use 
- store multiple first

		STM	0,15,SAVEAREA

- Load multiple, put paramlist into registers
- ie
		LM	2,4,0(1)	R2 -> num1
					R3 -> num2
					R4 -> num3
- 2nd LTROG goes below subroutine 
- before leaving

		LM	0,15,SAVEAREA	

- subroutines do not use using statements when they are internal
- load num1 into r2

	L	2,0(,2)		R2=num1

- this deletes the reference, so be careful
- now num2 into r3
	
	L	3,0(,3)		R3=num2

- loads and stores are only from fullwords
- Storing 
	
	ST	2,0(,4)		STORE R4 into num3


- so long as the storage is within 4095 -> X'FFF' then two base registers would be necessary
- when done with subroutine, 	BR	11


###Day Split 28
---------------------------------------------------
- no xprnt's in the subroutine
- no xreads in the subroutine
- save all of the caller's registers
- xprnt a message when entering subroutine to check (like cout with the variables)
- do reference variables directly in the subroutine



###Day Split 29
---------------------------------------------------

- in assist, multiple csects go in the same program. this mocks having asm files split up
- only one end statement at the end

#####Std. Linkage
1. point r1 to parameter list
2. get address of teh subroutine into r15
3. call the routine

- 2 is done by:		L	R,=V(Subroutine name here)
- step 3 is done by using balr via:  	label 	BALR	R,R
- in our case, 14 points back to where we want to return, while 15 points to where we want to go to

- so
1. load parm address into 1
2. load v-com(virtual-type literal) into 15
3. BALR		14,15

- conventions
- every program must begin with CSECT
- reference class notes 18 (External Subroutines)
- exit standard linkage is important
#####End Std. Linkage

###Day Split 30
---------------------------------------------------
- take current assignment, turn internal subroutines into external subroutines
- final due 9:50am wednesday 13th
- will be an expansion of hw 9
- numbers in hex are stored
	for 500		F5F0F0
- zoned decimal
	DC	Z'F4B5'		-45
	DC	Z'F4D5'		-45
	
- so
	34759
- is
	Z'F3F4F7F5F9'
- and
	-34759
	Z'F3F4F7F5B9'
- no more xdeci, now packed decimal
- F,A,C,E  -  positive    B,D  - negative      -- in the last byte
- zoned decimal
	Z'342178'
	F3F4F2F1F7F8
- packed decimal
	P'342178'
	0342178F
	
- to pack (from A to B)
		PACK	B(length(minimum number of bytes)),A(length)
				LTORG
		A	DC	Z'320452'
		B	DC	P'423142'		
- from pack
		UNPK	A(length),B(length)
- this unpacks from B to A
- longest packed decimal is 16 bytes
- if a packed decimal field is declared but is messed up, expect S0C7
- also, if it is not declared specifically, declare the correct length and initialize to zero
		B	DC	PL4'0'



###Day Split 31
--------------------------------------------------

- packed decimal (last lesson)
- converting packed decimal
- never use mvc
- never let lengths default
- always initialize packed storage to 0
- S0C7 - occurs if the number stored in one of the two operands is not a valid packed decimal

- for conversion, (n/2) + 1 is the size of pack for zoned to packed
	ie	zoned = 6
	6/2 + 1 = 4
	packed = 4 bytes
	
- record
	F3F4F1F2F7F5
	
- so AP - add packed    SP - subtract packed
	XREAD	BUFFER,80			    NO XDECI OR DECO UNLESS SPECIFIC CASES
	PACK	PDEPAMT(4),DEPAMT(6)     TAKES ZONED DECIMAL FROM RECORD AND PACKS IT
	AP		PDEPAMT(6),PINTAMT(4)    ADD PACKED
	ZAP		PCALFLD(8),PDEPAMT(4)    ZERO AND ADD PACKED, USED TO MOVE, NOT MVC
	MP		PCALFLD(8),PINTAMT(4)	   MULTIPLY PCALFLD BY PINTAMT
	ZAP		PDEPAMT(4),PCALFLD+4(4) TAKES ONLY THE LAST 4 BYTES AND MOVES THEM
	
	LTORG
	BUFFER	DS	0H
	DEPAMT	DC	ZL6'3412.75'
			DS	CL74
	PDEPAMT DC	PL4'0'		           ALWAYS INITIALIZE PACKED DECIMAL TO 0
	PINTAMT  DC	PL4'34.75'	
	PCALFLD  DC	PL8'0'			   RECEIVES MULTIPLIED PACKED DECIMAL 


###Day Split 32
-----------------------------------------------------
- if there are letters in the field where there should be numbers, then it is likely there are negative numbers
- first 25 characters are names
- everything else on the line is account numbers
- zoned decimal ie D9 is a negative number
- always initialize a packed decimal with DC and a default value
- move name to printline 	MVC	Buffer(25),0(2)
- first 9 digits are account 
- pack first number	PACK	PACKEDAREA(5),25(9,2)
- last four digits are interest rate
- decimal is halfway through
- packing the bytes into storage
- shift right is divide by power of ten, shift left is multiply by power ten
- shift right is 64 - value, left is just value
- this
	MVC		OCUSTNAME(25),0(2)		COPY NAME INTO OUTPUT FIELD
	PACK		PACCTBAL(5),25(9,2)		PACK ACCOUNT BALANCE
	PACK		PINTRATE(3),34(4,2)		PACK INTEREST RATE
	ZAP			PCALCINT(8), PACCTBAL(5)	MOVE ACCOUNT BALANCE INTO LARGER FIELD
	MP			PCALCINT(8), PINTRATE(3)	MULTIPLY ACCOUNT BALANCE BY INTEREST RATE
	SRP			PCALCINT(8), 64-4, 5		SHIFT 4 DIGITS RIGHT(DIVIDE BY 10000)
	LA			1,OINTAMT+9
	MVC		OINTAMT(13), =X'40206B2020206B2021204B2020'
	LTORG
	PINTRATE	DC	PL3'0'
	PACCTBAL	DC	PL5'0'
	PCALCINT	DC	PL8'0'
	OINTAMT		DS	CL13
	
	>> output	$ _ , _ _ _ , _ _ _ . _ _ 
	
- will call the subroutine as many times as there are records
- number can be assumed to be fit into 5 bytes
- output will be PCALCINT + 3(5)
- printline will take 13 bytes
